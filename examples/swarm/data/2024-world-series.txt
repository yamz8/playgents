The 2024 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2024 season. The 120th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers and the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees. The series began on October 25 and ended on October 30 with the Dodgers winning in five games.[1][2] Freddie Freeman of Los Angeles was named World Series Most Valuable Player for the first time in his career, tying a World Series record with 12 runs batted in (RBIs) while hitting home runs in the first four games of the series, including the first walk-off grand slam in a World Series in Game 1.[3][4] This is the first full-season recognized World Series championship for the Dodgers since the 1988 World Series.

The Dodgers and Yankees entered the 2024 MLB postseason as the top seeds in their leagues. It was the 12th time in the Dodgersâ€“Yankees rivalry that the teams have met in the World Series, after facing each other at least once in each decade from the 1940s through the 1980s; the Yankees won six of the first seven matchups when the Dodgers were crosstown rivals based in Brooklyn, with the teams splitting the four series after the Dodgers relocated. The Dodgers had home-field advantage in the series due to their better regular season win-loss record. The Dodgers last won a title in the 2020 World Series.
